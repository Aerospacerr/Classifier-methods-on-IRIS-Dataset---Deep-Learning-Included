## General info
We did perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Iris dataset before, here this link:
https://github.com/Aerospacerr/Iris-Dataset-Exploratory-Data-Analysis

Now we will implement classifier methods as a benchmark for Iris dataset. It will be a live script which I will try to update weekly with different methods and try to improve method's accuracy. Just for start, it includes K-means & Decision tree classifier and also a Deep Learning-Neural Network predictor for classification.

## Dataset info
Iris dataset is the best known dataset in the machine learning literature. It contains 150 samples, 50 samples for each of the 3 classes. Class labels are given in the last column of the dataset as integer values and 0, 1, 2 refers to setosa, versicolor, virginica respectively.

1. sepal length in cm
2. sepal width in cm
3. petal length in cm
4. petal width in cm
5. class:
-- Iris Setosa
-- Iris Versicolour
-- Iris Virginica

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* PyCharm: 2021.3 
* Pandas: 1.3.4 
* Numpy
* Scikit
* Tensorflow

## Developments 
It will be a live document. As machine learning methods added, we try to update.
